### 📶 **How Meshtastic Works**  

Meshtastic is a long-range, open-source communication network designed to function without traditional cell towers or internet access. It is highly resilient and designed to avoid single points of failure. Here's how it works:

1. **Device-to-Device Communication**:  
   Meshtastic devices form a decentralized mesh network, where messages hop from one device to another until they reach their destination. This allows communication over large distances, even in remote areas, by relaying messages through multiple devices.  

2. **Network Resilience (No Single Point of Failure)**:  
   If a node, repeater, or router in the network goes offline, the mesh will automatically route messages through other available nodes. This redundancy ensures that the network continues operating smoothly, avoiding disruption from any single point of failure. ⚙️🔄

3. **Unlicensed ISM Band Usage**:  
   Meshtastic operates on the **Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM)** band, which is free to use and does **not require a license**. In the United States, Meshtastic devices typically use the **915 MHz** frequency. This frequency offers an ideal balance of range and penetration through obstacles like buildings and trees.  

4. **Power & Range**:  
   Devices can legally transmit up to **1 watt (30 dBm)** of power on the ISM band, providing significant coverage even in remote areas. The mesh network's relaying capabilities further extend its range by passing messages through intermediate nodes.

Meshtastic is an excellent solution for outdoor enthusiasts, emergency responders, and communities aiming to maintain reliable communication when traditional networks are unavailable. 🌐📡

## 📍 **Coverage Goals**  

### **Phase 1:** Trabuco Canyon populated areas  
- **Cooks Corner** 🏍️  
- **Homes directly off Live Oak** 🏡  
- **Homes on Trabuco Oaks and connected streets** 🌄  
- **Rosa Cantina Restaurant**, **Windy Ridge**, and connected streets 🌲  
- **Holy Jim** 🔥 to the **Flying Field** 🛩️ and the **Cabins** (future expansion)  

### **Phase 2:** Extended areas of Trabuco Canyon 🌐  
- Expanding mesh coverage to more remote and less-populated areas.  

### **Phase 3:** Surrounding canyons and communities 🏞️  
- **Modjeska Canyon**  
- **Silverado Canyon**  
- **Williams Canyon**  
- **Black Star Canyon**  

The goal is to create best effort, **encrypted off-grid communication** throughout the entire canyon region! 📡

## 🌄 **Extending Range with High-Elevation Nodes**

To expand **TCMESH** coverage across **Trabuco Canyon** and connect neighboring canyons, we are deploying **high-elevation, solar-powered, remote-configurable nodes**. These specialized nodes are designed to act as **point-to-point routers**, bridging communication between different areas.  

### **Key Features:**  
- 📡 **Long-range distance:** Equipped with **tuned antennas** to maximize coverage across rugged terrain.  
- ☀️ **Solar-powered:** Ensures continuous operation without relying on external power sources.  
- 🔧 **Remote-configurable:** Easily managed and updated remotely to maintain optimal performance.  
- 🌐 **Inter-canyon connectivity:** Facilitates best effort communication between **Trabuco Canyon**, **Modjeska**, **Silverado**, **Williams**, and **Black Star Canyons**.  
- 📻 **Station G2 radios for extended range:** Uses **higher-output radios** with **tuned receivers and transmitters**, optimized to reach longer distances.  
  - Equipped with **5-7dB gain** **915MHz antennas** for improved transmission and reception over challenging terrain.  

### **Costs:**  
- Estimated build price: **$150** or turn-key **$250** to **$450** per node.
- Nodes will serve as key infrastructure points, linking seperate communities, enhancing the mesh network's reliability and coverage.

By strategically placing these nodes on high ground, we can ensure robust, off-grid communication throughout the canyon network! 📡🏞️  

This allows **off-grid** communication across any connected nodes. Perfect for use in natural disasters, areas with poor reception, or for tech enthusiasts looking to experiment with mesh networking. 🛰️

## 🤝 **We Need Your Help!**  
We're looking for:  
- **Nerds, hardware hackers, and radio enthusiasts** 🎙️ to help expand the network and write code.  
- **Volunteers** to place **repeaters** on their property 🏠 to improve coverage. Ideal spots have good line-of-sight to neighboring areas.
- **Host a Fund Raiser** - we are looking to raise a minimum of $1,000 through a resaurant fund raiser.  If you have experience doing this, please reach us on the mesh network.
- **Community Leaders** - find funds to buy nodes and work with neighbors to place them on their property
By placing repeaters, we can strengthen coverage across the canyon and beyond!

## ✅ **Current Progress**  
- **Live this week!**  ETA Feb 8th, 2025
- Successful tests have enabled conversations across **Orange County**.  
- Focused on building reliable communication throughout **Trabuco Canyon**.

## 🎯 **Future Goals for TC Mesh**  

We're continuously working to expand and enhance the **TC Mesh Network** to better serve our community. Here are some of our key goals for the future:

1. **High-Powered Solar Node BBS** ☀️📡  
   - Set up a high-powered, solar-powered node to function as a **Bulletin Board System (BBS)** based on [Meshing Around](https://github.com/SpudGunMan/meshing-around). This will enable users to leave and retrieve messages when offline, creating a more robust communication system.

2. **Document Roll-Out & Community Involvement** 📋👥  
   - Track and document the network’s roll-out process, including community involvement metrics.  
   - Present this use case to **SoCal Mesh** and national tech events to showcase how we built and expanded our mesh network.

3. **Feature TC Mesh at the 4th of July Parade** 🎆🇺🇸  
   - Highlight **TC Mesh** during the annual **4th of July Parade**, promoting its benefits and encouraging community participation.

4. **501(c)(3) Partnership** 🤝🏛️  
   - Attach **TC Mesh** as a chapter of an existing **501(c)(3)** nonprofit.  
   - Since our project is small, this approach avoids the expenses and administrative burden of managing a separate nonprofit.

5. **Build Days & In-Person Meetups** 🔧🍔  
   - Organize regular **build days** and **meetups** for both **Trabuco Canyon Meshers** and **SoCal Meshers**.  
   - Support local restaurants that offer **revenue-sharing** by donating a portion of the proceeds to fund future network builds.
  
6. **MQTT Server & Node Mapping** 🗺️📊  
   - Set up an **MQTT server** to log messages and build a dynamic map of nodes. The **TCMESH channel** will automatically **desensitize GPS positions** to **0.9 miles** to protect users' exact locations while maintaining network functionality.


By achieving these goals, we aim to strengthen the network, foster collaboration, and ensure that **TC Mesh** remains a vital, off-grid communication resource for our community! 🌐✨
