# TCMESH - Trabuco Canyon Mesh Network 🌄🛰️  

Welcome to **TCMESH**, a community-driven project to create a **peer-to-peer encrypted communication network** across **Trabuco Canyon, CA.** using **Meshtastic**. This network operates completely **off-grid**—with no internet or cell service required! 🌐  

### 🚨 **Our Mission**  

To **unite our community** with a **secure, alternate communication network** for **curiosity, connection, and emergency preparedness**.  
Stay connected during events like **fires**, **fallen poles**, and **flooding** 🌊🔥, without relying on **SCE power**, **internet**, **radio repeaters**, or **cell towers** ⚡📶.

### 📶 **How Meshtastic Works**  

Meshtastic (aka Lora Mesh Networking) is a long-range, open-source communication network designed to function without traditional cell towers or internet access. It is highly resilient and designed to avoid single points of failure. Here's how it works:

1. **Device-to-Device Communication**:  
   Meshtastic devices form a decentralized mesh network 🌐, where messages hop between devices to reach their destination 🚀, enabling communication over long distances, even in remote areas 🌄.

2. **Network Resilience**:  
   If a node goes offline ⚠️, the mesh automatically reroutes messages 🔄 through other available nodes, ensuring continuous operation without disruption 🔧.

3. **Unlicensed Usage**:  
   Meshtastic operates on the 915 MHz frequency in the unlicensed ISM band 📡, offering long-range communication without the need for a license 🚫.

4. **Power & Range**:  
   Devices can transmit up to 1 watt (30 dBm) ⚡ of power, providing extensive coverage 🌍, with the network’s relaying further extending its range 📶.

Example: Notice how Bobby can talk to Jack, even through they aren't close to each other (Bobby is blocked due to weather and houses).

## ⚙️ **Quick Start**  

1. **Get a Device**: 👉 Starting at $40 and great for walking around the [SenseCap Tracker T1000-E](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Card-Tracker-T1000-E-for-Meshtastic-p-5913.html) or browse higher powered nodes and solar repeaters starting at $60 [Etsy Store](https://www.etsy.com/people/i9v8id6n/favorites/tcmesh-meshtastic-turn-key-devices)  
2. **Install the App:** [Download the Meshtastic app on iOS (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meshtastic/id1586432531) or [Android (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeksville.mesh&pcampaignid=web_share). 📲  
3. **Connect Your Phone**: Use your **iPhone** or **Android** and select your new shiny Meshtastic device via **bluetooth**.
4. **Configure your device**: Go to meshtastic app, settings, user, and choose any shortname and long name you want.  For example mine is shortname: 🦅 long name: EAGLE - TCMESH. **Important** use TCMESH in your long name so we can include your anonymized location on our future TCMESH map.
5. **Join the Network**: Once connected, your device will automatically communicate with other nodes on the mesh.  Go to messages and chat in the primary channel or go to nodes and private message (**encrypted**) with any node in the network.

## 🎯 **Future Goals for TC Mesh**  

We're continuously working to expand and enhance the **TCMESH** to better serve our community. Here are some of our key goals for the future:

1. **High-Powered Solar Node BBS** ☀️📡  
   - Set up a high-powered, solar-powered node to function as a **Bulletin Board System (BBS)** based on [Meshing Around](https://github.com/SpudGunMan/meshing-around). This will enable users to leave and retrieve messages when offline, creating a more robust communication system.

2. **Document Roll-Out & Community Involvement** 📋👥  
   - Track and document the network’s roll-out process, including community involvement metrics.  
   - Present this use case to **SoCalMesh** and other forms of media to showcase our network and extend our reach.

3. **Feature TC Mesh at the 4th of July Parade** 🎆🇺🇸  
   - Highlight **TCMESH** during the annual **4th of July Parade**, promoting its benefits and encouraging community participation.

4. **501(c)(3) Partnership** 🤝🏛️  
   - Attach **TCMESH** as a chapter of an existing **501(c)(3)** nonprofit.  
   - Since our project is small, this approach avoids the expenses and administrative burden of managing a separate nonprofit.

5. **Build Days & In-Person Meetups** 🔧🍔  
   - Organize **build days** and **meetups** for both **Trabuco Canyon Meshers** and **SoCal Meshers**.  
   - Support local restaurants that offer **revenue-sharing** by donating a portion of the proceeds to fund **TCMESH**.
  
6. **MQTT Server & Node Mapping** 🗺️📊  
   - Set up an **MQTT server** to log messages and build a dynamic map of **TCMESH** nodes. The **TCMESH channel** will automatically **desensitize GPS positions** to **0.9 miles** to protect users' exact locations while maintaining network functionality but will give us an idea of where everyone is at so we can design proper radio frequency coverage.


By achieving these goals, we aim to strengthen the network, foster collaboration, and ensure that **TCMESH** remains a vital, off-grid communication resource for our community! 🌐✨
