# TCMESH - Trabuco Canyon Mesh Network 🌄🛰️  

Welcome to **TCMESH**, a community-driven project to create a **peer-to-peer encrypted communication network** across **Trabuco Canyon, CA** using **Meshtastic**. This network operates completely **off-grid**—no internet or cell service required! 🌐  

Our goal is to provide **alternate, secure communication** during emergencies or for staying connected in remote areas.

## 📍 **Coverage Goals**  

### **Phase 1:** Trabuco Canyon populated areas  
- **Cooks Corner** 🏍️  
- **Homes directly off Live Oak** 🏡  
- **Homes on Trabuco Oaks and connected streets** 🌄  
- **Rosa Cantina Restaurant**, **Windy Ridge**, and connected streets 🌲  
- **Holy Jim** 🔥 to the **Flying Field** 🛩️ and the **Cabins** (future expansion)  

### **Phase 2:** Extended areas of Trabuco Canyon 🌐  
- Expanding mesh coverage to more remote and less-populated areas.  

### **Phase 3:** Surrounding canyons and communities 🏞️  
- **Modjeska Canyon**
