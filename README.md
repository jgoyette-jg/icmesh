# TCMESH - Trabuco Canyon Mesh Network 🌄🛰️  

Welcome to **TCMESH**, a community-driven project to create a **peer-to-peer encrypted communication network** across **Trabuco Canyon, CA** using **Meshtastic**. This network operates completely **off-grid**—no internet or cell service required! 🌐  

Our goal is to provide **semi-reliable, secure communication** during emergencies or for staying connected in remote areas.

## 📍 **Coverage Goals (Phase 1)**  
We're building coverage across Trabuco Canyon, including:  
- Cooks Corner 🏍️  
- Trabuco Oaks 🌲  
- Rose Canyon 🏞️  
- Holy Jim 🔥  
- Flying field 🛩️

## ⚙️ **How It Works**  
1. **Get a Device**: Purchase a **Meshtastic-compatible** device, such as:  
   👉 [Heltec V3 running Meshtastic by Ukielab](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1718195697/heltec-v3-running-meshtastic-by-ukielab)  
2. **Connect Your Phone**: Use your **iPhone** or **Android** to connect via **Bluetooth**.  
3. **Join the Network**: Your device will automatically communicate with other nodes on the mesh.  

This allows **off-grid** communication across any connected nodes. Perfect for use in natural disasters, areas with poor reception, or for tech enthusiasts looking to experiment with mesh networking. 🛰️

## 🤝 **We Need Your Help!**  
We're looking for:  
- **Nerds, hardware hackers, and radio enthusiasts** 🎙️ to help expand the network.  
- **Volunteers** to place **repeaters** on their property 🏠 to improve coverage. Ideal spots have good line-of-sight to neighboring areas.  

By placing repeaters, we can strengthen coverage across the canyon and beyond!
