# ICMESH - Inter-Canyon Mesh Text Message Network üåÑüõ∞Ô∏è

**ICMESH** is a community-driven project creating a peer-to-peer encrypted communication network across Trabuco Canyon, CA, using **Meshtastic**. This off-grid network operates without internet or cell service, designed for curiosity, connection, and emergency preparedness during events like fires, fallen poles, and flooding.

## Mission
Unite the Trabuco Canyon community with a secure, alternate communication network, ensuring connectivity without relying on traditional infrastructure like SCE power, internet, radio repeaters, or cell towers.

## How It Works
Meshtastic (Lora Mesh Networking) forms a decentralized, resilient network where devices communicate over long distances, rerouting messages if nodes fail, using unlicensed 915 MHz frequencies for extensive coverage.

## Get Involved
- Join with a Meshtastic device (e.g., SenseCap Tracker, WisMesh Pocket) and the Meshtastic app.
- Help expand coverage, place routers, or fund the network.
- Participate in weekly nets every Wednesday at 7:00 PM PT.
