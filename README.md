# TCMESH - Trabuco Canyon Mesh Network 🌄🛰️  

Welcome to **TCMESH**, a community-driven project to create a **peer-to-peer encrypted communication network** across **Trabuco Canyon, CA** using **Meshtastic**. This network operates completely **off-grid**—no internet or cell service required! 🌐  

### 🚨 **Our Mission**  

To **unite our community** by building and maintaining an **alternate, secure communication network** for emergencies. This network will keep us connected without relying on traditional infrastructure like **SCE power**, **internet**, or **cell towers**. 🌐📡

## 📍 **Coverage Goals**  

### **Phase 1:** Trabuco Canyon populated areas  
- **Cooks Corner** 🏍️  
- **Homes directly off Live Oak** 🏡  
- **Homes on Trabuco Oaks and connected streets** 🌄  
- **Rosa Cantina Restaurant**, **Windy Ridge**, and connected streets 🌲  
- **Holy Jim** 🔥 to the **Flying Field** 🛩️ and the **Cabins** (future expansion)  

### **Phase 2:** Extended areas of Trabuco Canyon 🌐  
- Expanding mesh coverage to more remote and less-populated areas.  

### **Phase 3:** Surrounding canyons and communities 🏞️  
- **Modjeska Canyon**  
- **Silverado Canyon**  
- **Williams Canyon**  
- **Black Star Canyon**  

The goal is to create best effort, **encrypted off-grid communication** throughout the entire canyon region! 📡

## 🌄 **Extending Range with High-Elevation Nodes**

To expand **TCMESH** coverage across **Trabuco Canyon** and connect neighboring canyons, we are deploying **high-elevation, solar-powered, remote-configurable nodes**. These specialized nodes are designed to act as **point-to-point routers**, bridging communication between different areas.  

### **Key Features:**  
- 📡 **Long-range distance:** Equipped with **tuned antennas** to maximize coverage across rugged terrain.  
- ☀️ **Solar-powered:** Ensures continuous operation without relying on external power sources.  
- 🔧 **Remote-configurable:** Easily managed and updated remotely to maintain optimal performance.  
- 🌐 **Inter-canyon connectivity:** Facilitates best effort communication between **Trabuco Canyon**, **Modjeska**, **Silverado**, **Williams**, and **Black Star Canyons**.  
- 📻 **Station G2 radios for extended range:** Uses **higher-output radios** with **tuned receivers and transmitters**, optimized to reach longer distances.  
  - Equipped with **5-7dB gain** **915MHz antennas** for improved transmission and reception over challenging terrain.  

### **Costs and Requirements:**  
- Estimated price range: **$250 to $500** per node.  
- Nodes will serve as key infrastructure points, enhancing the mesh network's reliability and coverage in critical areas.

By strategically placing these nodes on high ground, we can ensure robust, off-grid communication throughout the canyon network! 📡🏞️  






This allows **off-grid** communication across any connected nodes. Perfect for use in natural disasters, areas with poor reception, or for tech enthusiasts looking to experiment with mesh networking. 🛰️

## 🤝 **We Need Your Help!**  
We're looking for:  
- **Nerds, hardware hackers, and radio enthusiasts** 🎙️ to help expand the network.  
- **Volunteers** to place **repeaters** on their property 🏠 to improve coverage. Ideal spots have good line-of-sight to neighboring areas.
- **Host a Fund Raiser** - we are looking to raise a minimum of $1,000 through a resaurant fund raiser.  If you have experience doing this, please reach us on the mesh network.

By placing repeaters, we can strengthen coverage across the canyon and beyond!
