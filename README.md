# TCMESH - Trabuco Canyon Mesh Network 🌄🛰️  

Welcome to **TCMESH**, a community-driven project to create a **peer-to-peer encrypted communication network** across **Trabuco Canyon, CA.** using **Meshtastic**. This network operates completely **off-grid**—with no internet or cell service required! 🌐  

### 🚨 **Our Mission**  

To **unite our community** with a **secure, alternate communication network** for **curiosity, connection, and emergency preparedness**.  
Stay connected during events like **fires**, **fallen poles**, and **flooding** 🌊🔥, without relying on **SCE power**, **internet**, **radio repeaters**, or **cell towers** ⚡📶.

### 📶 **How Meshtastic Works**  

Meshtastic (aka Lora Mesh Networking) is a long-range, open-source communication network designed to function without traditional cell towers or internet access. It is highly resilient and designed to avoid single points of failure. Here's how it works:

1. **Device-to-Device Communication**:  
   Meshtastic devices form a decentralized mesh network 🌐, where messages hop between devices to reach their destination 🚀, enabling communication over long distances, even in remote areas 🌄.

2. **Network Resilience**:  
   If a node goes offline ⚠️, the mesh automatically reroutes messages 🔄 through other available nodes, ensuring continuous operation without disruption 🔧.

3. **Unlicensed Usage**:  
   Meshtastic operates on the 915 MHz frequency in the unlicensed ISM band 📡, offering long-range communication without the need for a license 🚫.

4. **Power & Range**:  
   Devices can transmit up to 1 watt (30 dBm) ⚡ of power, providing extensive coverage 🌍, with the network’s relaying further extending its range 📶.

Example: Notice how Bobby can talk to Jack, even though they are blocked from direct line of sight.

## ⚙️ **Quick Start**  

1. **Get a Device**: 👉 Starting at $40 and great for walking around the [SenseCap Tracker T1000-E](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Card-Tracker-T1000-E-for-Meshtastic-p-5913.html) (direct Link) or [SenseCap Tracker on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJ6KGXKB/) is an excellent mobile device or browse higher powered nodes and solar repeaters starting at $60 [Etsy Store](https://www.etsy.com/people/i9v8id6n/favorites/tcmesh-meshtastic-turn-key-devices)  
2. **Install the App:** [Download the Meshtastic app on iOS (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meshtastic/id1586432531) or [Android (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeksville.mesh&pcampaignid=web_share). 📲  
3. **Connect Your Phone**: Use your **iPhone** or **Android** and select your new shiny Meshtastic device via **bluetooth**.
4. **Configure your device**: Go to meshtastic app, settings, user, and choose any shortname and long name you want.  For example mine is shortname: 🦅 long name: EAGLE - TCMESH. **Important** use TCMESH in your long name so we can include your anonymized location on our future TCMESH map.
5. **Join the Network**: Once connected, your device will automatically communicate with other nodes on the mesh.  Go to messages and chat in the primary channel or go to nodes and private message (**encrypted**) with any node in the network.

## 🤝 **We Need Your Help!**

We're looking for:

- **Nerds, hardware hackers, and radio enthusiasts** 🎙️ to help expand the network with hardware and code to improve network resiliency.
- **Volunteers** to place **routers** on their property 🏠 to enhance coverage. Ideal spots are at high elevations with good line-of-sight to neighboring areas and router nodes.
- **Advocates** to spread the word and recruit more community members.
- **Fundraisers** – Partner with a restaurant to share revenue with TCMESH. Our goal is to raise $1,000 to build the initial router network.
- **Community Leaders** to secure funding, collaborate with government agencies, and invest in turnkey nodes for optimal property placements.
