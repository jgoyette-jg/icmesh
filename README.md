# TCMESH - Trabuco Canyon Mesh Network 🌄🛰️  

Welcome to **TCMESH**, a community-driven project to create a **peer-to-peer encrypted communication network** across **Trabuco Canyon, CA** using **Meshtastic**. This network operates completely **off-grid**—no internet or cell service required! 🌐  

### 🚨 **Our Mission**  

To **unite our community** by building and maintaining an **alternate, secure communication network** for emergencies. This network will keep us connected without relying on traditional infrastructure like **SCE power**, **internet**, or **cell towers**. 🌐📡

### 📶 **How Meshtastic Works**  

Meshtastic is a long-range, open-source communication network designed to work without traditional cell towers or internet access. Here's how it works:

1. **Device-to-Device Communication**:  
   Meshtastic devices form a mesh network, meaning messages can hop from one device to another until they reach their destination. This allows communication over large distances, even in remote areas, by relaying messages through multiple devices.  

2. **Unlicensed ISM Band Usage**:  
   Meshtastic operates on the **Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM)** band, which is free to use and does **not require a license**. In the United States, Meshtastic devices typically use the **915 MHz** frequency. This frequency offers a good balance of range and penetration through obstacles like buildings and trees.  

3. **Power & Range**:  
   Devices can legally transmit up to **1 watt (30 dBm)** of power on the ISM band, providing significant coverage even in remote areas. The mesh network extends communication by allowing each device to act as a relay, further increasing the range of the system.

Meshtastic is a perfect solution for outdoor enthusiasts, emergency responders, and communities looking to maintain communication when traditional networks are unavailable. 🌐📡

## 📍 **Coverage Goals**  

### **Phase 1:** Trabuco Canyon populated areas  
- **Cooks Corner** 🏍️  
- **Homes directly off Live Oak** 🏡  
- **Homes on Trabuco Oaks and connected streets** 🌄  
- **Rosa Cantina Restaurant**, **Windy Ridge**, and connected streets 🌲  
- **Holy Jim** 🔥 to the **Flying Field** 🛩️ and the **Cabins** (future expansion)  

### **Phase 2:** Extended areas of Trabuco Canyon 🌐  
- Expanding mesh coverage to more remote and less-populated areas.  

### **Phase 3:** Surrounding canyons and communities 🏞️  
- **Modjeska Canyon**  
- **Silverado Canyon**  
- **Williams Canyon**  
- **Black Star Canyon**  

The goal is to create best effort, **encrypted off-grid communication** throughout the entire canyon region! 📡

## 🌄 **Extending Range with High-Elevation Nodes**

To expand **TCMESH** coverage across **Trabuco Canyon** and connect neighboring canyons, we are deploying **high-elevation, solar-powered, remote-configurable nodes**. These specialized nodes are designed to act as **point-to-point routers**, bridging communication between different areas.  

### **Key Features:**  
- 📡 **Long-range distance:** Equipped with **tuned antennas** to maximize coverage across rugged terrain.  
- ☀️ **Solar-powered:** Ensures continuous operation without relying on external power sources.  
- 🔧 **Remote-configurable:** Easily managed and updated remotely to maintain optimal performance.  
- 🌐 **Inter-canyon connectivity:** Facilitates best effort communication between **Trabuco Canyon**, **Modjeska**, **Silverado**, **Williams**, and **Black Star Canyons**.  
- 📻 **Station G2 radios for extended range:** Uses **higher-output radios** with **tuned receivers and transmitters**, optimized to reach longer distances.  
  - Equipped with **5-7dB gain** **915MHz antennas** for improved transmission and reception over challenging terrain.  

### **Costs and Requirements:**  
- Estimated price range: **$250 to $500** per node.  
- Nodes will serve as key infrastructure points, enhancing the mesh network's reliability and coverage in critical areas.

By strategically placing these nodes on high ground, we can ensure robust, off-grid communication throughout the canyon network! 📡🏞️  






This allows **off-grid** communication across any connected nodes. Perfect for use in natural disasters, areas with poor reception, or for tech enthusiasts looking to experiment with mesh networking. 🛰️

## 🤝 **We Need Your Help!**  
We're looking for:  
- **Nerds, hardware hackers, and radio enthusiasts** 🎙️ to help expand the network.  
- **Volunteers** to place **repeaters** on their property 🏠 to improve coverage. Ideal spots have good line-of-sight to neighboring areas.
- **Host a Fund Raiser** - we are looking to raise a minimum of $1,000 through a resaurant fund raiser.  If you have experience doing this, please reach us on the mesh network.

By placing repeaters, we can strengthen coverage across the canyon and beyond!
