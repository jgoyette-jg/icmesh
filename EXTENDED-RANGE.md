## 🌄 **Extending Range with High-Elevation Router Nodes**

To expand **TCMESH** coverage across **Trabuco Canyon** and connect neighboring canyons, we are deploying **high-elevation, solar-powered, remote-configurable router nodes**. These specialized nodes are designed to repeat traffic quickly, bridging communication between different areas.

### **Key Features:**  
- 📡 **Long-range distance:** Equipped with **tuned antennas** to maximize coverage across rugged terrain.  
- ☀️ **Solar-powered:** Ensures continuous operation without relying on external power sources.  
- 🔧 **Remote-configurable:** We will use remote administration public keys to manage these nodes to update software and maintain optimal performance.  
- 🌐 **Inter-canyon connectivity:** Facilitates best effort communication between **Trabuco Canyon**, **Modjeska**, **Silverado**, **Williams**, and **Black Star Canyons**.  
- 📻 **Station G2 radios for extended range:** Uses **higher-output radios** with **tuned receivers and transmitters**, optimized to reach longer distances.  
  - Equipped with **5-7dB gain** **915MHz antennas** for improved transmission and reception over challenging terrain.  We will carefully consider use of omni-direction vs. yagi antennas and are also researching how to combine both a yagi and omni node to provide this bridge.

### **Costs to build a router:**  
- Estimated build price: DIY **$150** or turn-key **$250** to **$450** per node.
- Nodes will serve as key infrastructure points, linking seperate communities, enhancing the mesh network's reliability and coverage.

By strategically placing these nodes on high ground, we can ensure robust, off-grid communication throughout the canyon network! 📡🏞️  

This allows **off-grid** communication across any connected nodes. Perfect for use in natural disasters, areas with poor reception, or for tech enthusiasts looking to experiment with mesh networking. 🛰️
