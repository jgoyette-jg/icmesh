## 🎯 **Future Goals for IC Mesh**  

We're continuously working to expand and enhance the **ICMESH** to better serve our community. Here are some of our key goals for the future:

1. **High-Powered Solar Node BBS** ☀️📡  
   - Set up a high-powered, solar-powered node to function as a **Bulletin Board System (BBS)** based on [Meshing Around](https://github.com/SpudGunMan/meshing-around). This will enable users to leave and retrieve messages when offline, creating a more robust communication system.

2. **Document Roll-Out & Community Involvement** 📋👥  
   - Track and document the network’s roll-out process, including community involvement metrics.  
   - Present this use case to **SoCalMesh** and other forms of media to showcase our network and extend our reach.

3. **Feature IC Mesh at the 4th of July Parade** 🎆🇺🇸  
   - Highlight **ICMESH** during the annual **4th of July Parade**, promoting its benefits and encouraging community participation.

4. **501(c)(3) Partnership** 🤝🏛️  
   - Attach **ICMESH** as a chapter of an existing **501(c)(3)** nonprofit.  
   - Since our project is small, this approach avoids the expenses and administrative burden of managing a separate nonprofit.

5. **Build Days & In-Person Meetups** 🔧🍔  
   - Organize **build days** and **meetups** for both **Trabuco Canyon Meshers** and **SoCal Meshers**.  
   - Support local restaurants that offer **revenue-sharing** by donating a portion of the proceeds to fund **ICMESH**.
  
6. **MQTT Server & Node Mapping** 🗺️📊  
   - Set up an **MQTT server** to log messages and build a dynamic map of **ICMESH** nodes. The **ICMESH channel** will automatically **desensitize GPS positions** to **0.9 miles** to protect users' exact locations while maintaining network functionality but will give us an idea of where everyone is at so we can design proper radio frequency coverage.
