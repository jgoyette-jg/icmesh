# Inter-Canyon Mesh Text Message Network 🌄🛰️  

Welcome to **ICMESH**, a community-driven project to create a **peer-to-peer encrypted communication network** across **our canyons** using **Meshtastic**. This network operates completely **off-grid**—with no internet or cell service required! 🌐  

---

### 📡 **How Does It Work?**  
We’ve placed several repeaters 📶 across the canyons, starting with Trabuco Canyon, to provide radio frequency coverage 🌍 over our rugged terrain. Using Meshtastic, an open-source mesh networking system 🌐, all you need is a small radio 📻 paired to your phone via Bluetooth 📲 to get up and running in minutes ⏱️—here’s how it works: Bobby can text Jack 💬 across the network, with messages hopping from device to device 🚀, bypassing obstacles and working without internet, power, or cell service 🚫

## ⚙️ **Quick Start**  

1. **Get a Device**: 👉 Starting at $40 and great for walking around the [SenseCap Tracker T1000-E](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Card-Tracker-T1000-E-for-Meshtastic-p-5913.html) (direct link) or [SenseCap Tracker on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJ6KGXKB/) is an excellent mobile device.  Note:  If Amazon is out of stock the price may show higher and in that case use the direct-link. The [WisMesh Pocket V2 for $99](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wismesh-pocket) is slightly more expensive at $99.  You can also check out our ICMESH favorites on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/people/i9v8id6n/favorites/ICMESH-meshtastic-turn-key-devices). **Warning:** Avoid devices with the Heltec v3 chip due to manufacturing defects. 
2. **Install the App:** [Download the Meshtastic app on iOS (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meshtastic/id1586432531) or [Android (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeksville.mesh&pcampaignid=web_share). 📲  
3. **Connect Your Phone**: Use your **iPhone** or **Android** and select your new shiny Meshtastic device via **bluetooth**.
4. **Configure your device**: Go to meshtastic app, settings, user, and choose any shortname and long name you want.  For example mine is shortname: AMY and long name: AMY - ICMESH.COM. **Important** Please use ICMESH in your long name so we can count how many people are on the network. 
5. **Join the Network**: Your device will automatically join the ICMESH network and will also work outside of the canyons.
6. **Send A Message**: In your mobile app, go to Channel to send a message to everyone or you can send directed messages to your friends.

## 🤝 **We Need Your Help!**

We're looking for:

- **Nerds, hardware hackers, and radio enthusiasts** 🎙️ to help expand the network with hardware and code to improve network resiliency.
- **Volunteers** to place **routers** on their property 🏠 to enhance coverage. Ideal spots are at high elevations with good line-of-sight to neighboring areas and router nodes.
- **Advocates** to spread the word and recruit more community members.
- **Fundraisers** – Partner with a restaurant to share revenue with ICMESH. Our goal is to raise $1,000 to build the initial router network.
- **Community Leaders** to secure funding, collaborate with government agencies, and invest in turnkey nodes for optimal property placements. 

---

## ✅ **Current Progress**  
- Solar node is live on Hamilton Trail
- Solar node is live at the top of Live Oak Canyon Grade (by Doody Residence)
- We have made successful tests between Hamilton and Cooks
- A new solar node is being built and will be placed near Windy Ridge to cover Trabuco Oaks Drive
- All the nodes will be line of sight of each other, extending range deep into the canyons

## **FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions**

**Do I need a license or technical knowledge?** - No license needed and the sensecap works out of the box.   

**What is RSSI and SNR mean?** - Meshtastic devices provide two key metrics to evaluate signal quality: **RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)** and **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**.  

In wireless communication, **RSSI** and **SNR** determine signal quality.

#### **RSSI** (Signal Strength)  
- Measures how strong the signal is (like how loud someone is speaking).  
  - **Good:** Above **-115 dBm**  
  - **Poor:** Below **-126 dBm**  
- **Analogy:** In a concert, voices can be loud (**RSSI = -80 dBm**) but still hard to hear due to noise.

#### **SNR** (Signal Clarity)  
- Measures how much louder the signal is compared to background noise.  
  - **Good:** Above **17.5 dB**  
  - **Poor:** Below **9 dB**  
- **Analogy:** In a quiet cafe, soft voices (**RSSI = -115 dBm**) are easy to understand because the noise is minimal (**SNR = 25 dB**).

Both strong **RSSI** and high **SNR** are needed for reliable communication.

| **Metric**   | **Good**                     | **Fair**                       | **Bad**                       | **Poor**                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **RSSI**     | 🟢 > -115 dBm                 | 🟡 -115 dBm to -120 dBm         | 🟠 -120 dBm to -126 dBm        | 🔴 ≤ -126 dBm              |
| **SNR**      | 🟢 > 17.5 dB                  | 🟡 11 dB to 17.5 dB             | 🟠 9 dB to 11 dB               | 🔴 < 9 dB                  |
